## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This is the first time I've used Frontend Mentor and have mainly struck with Codepen so far for practicing. I have had a blast doing this challenge. Using Frontend Mentor has helped me as I've never thoroughly used GitHub before and this challenge has helped me become familiar with it. This has helped me with "real world" coding because you complete the project from start to finish. It has also helped me reinforce my learning in CSS Grid and Flexbox. I grasp the basic concepts of these two display modes but I can definitely use the practice because I do think I need to have a better understanding. I have also got practice with using media queries.

### Continued development

I am going to continue studying and learning how to use media queries to better make a responsive website as well as practicing positioning using grid and flex.
